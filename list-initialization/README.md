## 📋 Problem Description

If we want to create an empty list of a specific size, this is the easiest way to do it in Python

The above code will create a list of 5 zeros. It might seem strange to multiply a list by a number, but this is the standard way to create a list of a specific size in Python. We could have replaced the 0 with any other value.

The above code will create a list of 3 ones.

ChallengeImplement the following function: which should create and return a list of length size. All values in the list should be 0, except for the value at index index, which should be the parameter value.

You may assume the index is within the bounds of the list. Time Complexity

Time complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n) where nnn is the size of the resulting list.
