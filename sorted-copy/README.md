## 📋 Problem Description

There is another way to sort a list in Python, using the sorted() function. The sorted() function returns a new list with the elements sorted in the specified order. The original list remains unchanged.

The sorted() function takes the list as the first argument and returns a new list with the elements sorted in ascending order by default.

You can also specify the order using the reverse parameter:

You can also pass a custom function to the key parameter to specify the sorting criteria.

For the most part, it's similar to the sort() method, but it returns a new list instead of modifying the original list.

ChallengeImplement the following functions: sort_words(words: List[str]) -> List[str] - This function accepts a list of words and returns a new list of words sorted in ascending order. Do not modify the original list.

sort_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int] - This function accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list of numbers sorted in descending order based on their absolute value. Do not modify the original list.
