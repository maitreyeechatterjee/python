## 📋 Problem Description

Earlier, if you attempted to run the following code before correcting it:

You may have seen something like this in the console:

This is the result of an error in our code. Specifically, it's a syntax error. Syntax errors occur when the code is not written correctly according to the rules of the programming language. It's not so different from a spelling or grammar error in a human language, except that computers are much less forgiving.

Sometimes you may get helpful error messages which help you identify the problem. Other times, the error message may not be as clear.

There are many types of programming errors such as syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors. Syntax errors are easier to fix, because they usually point out which line the error is on.

ChallengeIn the code editor, there is a syntax error. Correct the code so that it prints the following text to the console:

If you think you have the correct answer, click the Submit button. What is a runtime error? A runtime error is an error that occurs while the program is running. That means the syntax of the program itself is fine. It is usually caused by something that the programmer did not anticipate. Runtime errors can be difficult to debug because they may not always occur consistently. For example, if we programmed a calculator and the user tries to divide by zero, we will get a runtime error. What is a logical error? A logical error is an error that occurs when the program runs without crashing or producing an error, but the output is not what the programmer intended. This is commonly known as a bug. Logical errors can be difficult to find because as programmers we have to identify which lines of code are causing the incorrect output. There are various techniques to debug logical errors, but in large programs, it can still be very challenging.
