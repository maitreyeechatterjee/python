## 📋 Problem Description

An object is an instance of a class. It's a specific item created using the blueprint defined by the class.

Creating ObjectsWe have seen the class definition for a SuperHero before.

We can create an object by calling the class and passing in the required arguments.

When we write , we're telling Python: Create a new object variable called iron_man

Use the SuperHero class to create it

Set its name attribute to "Iron Man"

Set its power attribute to "repulsor beams"

Set its health attribute to 100

Set its speed attribute to 80 ChallengeYou have given the code for a Pet class. When run, this code produces an error:

To fix this error and get the expected output, complete the following task: Create a pet with a name of Whiskers, which is a cat with hunger level 6 and energy level 8. Note: The name of the variable should be whiskers (no uppercase). Expected Output: Hint Object creation: The importance of parameter order

When creating a new superhero object, the order of values must match the __init__ method: Example: Correct order Incorrect order

In the incorrect example, the order of attributes is mismatched. Be careful, Python won't give us any errors for this incorrect order, which means we need to be careful when creating our objects!
