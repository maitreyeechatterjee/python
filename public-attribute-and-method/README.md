## 📋 Problem Description

In Python, public attributes or methods can be accessed and modified directly from outside the class. By default, all attributes and methods in Python are public.

When an attribute or method is public, we can: Access it directly using dot notation

Modify the attribute from outside the class

Call the method from outside the class Let's see public attributes in action:

Public attributes are suitable when: The attribute doesn't need validation

Direct access won't compromise the object's integrity

You want to keep the code simple and straightforward Don't worry about the above for now, we will cover validation and integrity later.

ChallengeYou are given starter code for a simple shop system where items are displayed with their names and prices. Your tasks are: Add public attributes for name and price

Access the attributes of the chips object and display them. Use this format: Item: [name] - Price: $[price] for printing. Expected Output Hints Remember to initialize attributes in the init method

Use descriptive names for your attributes

Public attributes can be accessed using dot notation

Use the print function to display the attributes What is Encapsulation? Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and methods that work on the data within one unit, called a class. In addition, it restricts access to some of the object's components. The purpose is to hide the internal details of an object and only expose the necessary parts of the object to the outside world. A real world analogy is a car. The car is a complex system with many moving parts. However, as a driver, you don't need to know how the car works internally. You only need to know how to operate the car. Key Points About Public Attributes Public attributes are accessible from anywhere in the code

They're defined without any special naming convention

They offer direct access to object properties

They're suitable for simple, straightforward data storage

No special methods are needed to access or modify them
