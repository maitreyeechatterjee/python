## 📋 Problem Description

Instead of using the extend() method there's an even easier way to concatenate two lists in Python. We can use the + operator:

The only difference between this and the extend() method is that the + operator creates a new list, while the extend() method modifies the original list.

ChallengeImplement the following function: which takes two lists of integers and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list followed by all the elements of the second list. Do not modify the original lists. Time Complexity

Time complexity: O(n+m)O(n + m)O(n+m) where nnn is the length of one list and mmm is the length of the other list.
