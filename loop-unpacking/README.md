## 📋 Problem Description

We can also use unpacking in loops to iterate over a list of lists. This is useful when we know the size of the inner lists and want to unpack them into variables.

We could accomplish this without packing with slightly more code:

You can see we saved a line of code by using unpacking.

ChallengeImplement the following function using unpacking: that takes a list of tuples. Each tuple represents the (name, score) of a student. Find the student with the highest score and return their name. You may assume that a score will never be less than 0 and that only one student will have the highest score.
